# Vimfiles

This is the repo containing the current state of my Vim configuration. I use it for both writing code, and writing prose. You can read all about my problems, motivations and solutions [on a blog post](http://www.swamphogg.com/images/vim-setup/writing_env.png) I wrote.

Or you can look at some pretty pictures.
